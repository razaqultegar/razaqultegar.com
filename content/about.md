I live in Ghent, Belgium and am passionate about PHP. I'm a Laravel enthusiast and have used the framework for many projects.  Follow me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/razaqultegar) to know what keeps me busy. Want to know which IDE, apps and hardware I use? [Here you go](/uses)!

I'm a developer at [Spatie](https://spatie.be) of which I'm the co-owner. At my company we use a lot of open source software: PHP, Ubuntu, Laravel, Composer, Yarn,â€¦ are a few of the things we use everyday. My company couldn't exist without open source software. That's why we're trying to give back as much as possible.

Whenever we stumble upon a problem that we can solve in a clean way, we extract our solution so other developers can use it. Together with my colleagues I regularly release [PHP](https://spatie.be/opensource), [Laravel and JavaScript packages](https://spatie.be/opensource). Those packages have been downloaded more than 35 million times.
