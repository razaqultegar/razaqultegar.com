As usual, this is my setup, you do not have to use the same tool or anything, written for frequently asked questions or I want to help promote it as a thank you for helping me.

## Hardware

Both at home and at the office I'm using a Acer Aspire E14 with a Intel Core i3 (1,7 GHz, 3MB L3 cache), 6GB of RAM and 500GB Hardisk + 1TB External Hardisk from [Seagate](https://www.tokopedia.com/shopit-1/seagate-backup-plus-slim-usb-3-0-1tb-sthn1000400-black) and [Logitech Wireless Combo MK220](https://www.logitech.com/id-id/product/wireless-combo-mk220).

To stay in "the zone" when commuting and at the office I put on my [JBL Tune 120TWS](https://id.jbl.com/headphones-wireless/JBL+TUNE120TWS.html) wireless headphones for playing music (usually) and for communicating.

My current phone is an iPhone 6 Plus with 64 GB of storage.

## Linux

I'm a rarely upgrader of my operating system, so I'm always using the older version. Lastly I use Ubuntu 14.04 for a very long time and finally I decided to upgrade to a newer version that is 20.04.

By default I hide the dock. I like to keep my desktop ultra clean, even hard disks and trash aren't allowed to be displayed there. On my dock there aren't any sticky programs. Only frequently used and apps that are running are on there. I only have a stacks to Downloads and Desktop permanently on there. Here's a screenshot where I've deliberately moved my pointer sideways so the dock is shown.

These are some of the apps I'm using:

- I worked with a few people out there. When I can't meet in person, I use [AnyDesk](anydesk.com) to work on remote tasks.
- My favourite cloud storage solution is [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com). All my personal documents, photos, videos or anything are on there.
- My browser of choice is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome). To block ads on certain sites I use [the Ghostery plugin](https://www.ghostery.com).
- To run projects locally I use [LAMP Stack](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)>).
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com) is an amazing app to perform API calls.
- I love music. Rock, Metal, Pop Punk and Acoustic. Sometimes I also like listening to Podcasts. All that is in [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com), you can see a list of music that often I turn on my [Dashboard](/dashboard).
- Databases are managed with [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). There is no doubt that this text editor has succeeded in shifting my previous text editor, [Atom](https://atom.io). I don't know why, but this is the best text editor in my opinion.

## iOS

I don't use my phone for too long, most of my time is spent in Laptop. Notifications and notification badges are turned off for all apps except Messages.

Here's a rundown of some of the apps currently on the homescreen:

- BCA Mobile: horribly named, this the mobile banking app of my bank.
- Documents by Readdle: All your files. All in one app.
- Dropbox: the fastest apps for backup data from my phone to laptop
- Grab: like an Uber but in Indonesia.
- Spotify: you know, i love music. Everything and everywhere.
- Telegram, WhatsApp: for communicating with my team and some other communities.
- Traveloka: to easily look up the train schedules in Indonesia.
- Trello: contains my to dos, for personal or business.

## In closing

Every year, I write a new version of the post. If you have any questions on any of these apps and services, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/razaqultegar).
